# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
The r squared value here is 0.626. I think the r squared value means how closely the data points are to the line of best fit, or how well the points represent some sort of relationship between two variables.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
The value was 137.46 

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?  
I do not think the model is that good in predicting the blood pressure based upon someone's age. There are so many outliers in the model that stray far from the line of best fit and although it can be inferred that the blood pressure increases with age, it is not the best indiciator.
